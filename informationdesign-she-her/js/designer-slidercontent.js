        intro: "Ada Lovelace lived in the 19th century and was quite ahead of her time: She developed a computer programming system when computers were not yet invented. Back then, even in wealthy families like Lovelace&#8217;s, it was not common for women to get the same education as men. So Lovelace was lucky that her mother provided her with the best homeschool education. Especially Charles Babbage, today known as the inventor of the first mechanical computer, had a significant influence on her: He had been working on a mechanical calculating machine, and since Lovelace understood his quite complex thoughts, they started working together. Lovelace was only 36 when she died of cancer in 1852. In the 1970s, the computer language ADA was named after her and is still used.",

        intro: "Alice Urbach was an Austro-Jewish cookbook author, culinary teacher, and entrepreneur. In 1936 her cookbook &#8220;So Kocht Man in Wien!&#8221; became a bestseller. On almost 600 pages, she described recipes and cooking techniques. Nearly 100 photos demonstrate step-by-step cooking and baking skills. After the annexation of Austria by the Nazi regime in 1939, Urbach was forced to flee Austria. Due to the book's success, the publisher continued to sell her work under a different author&#8217;s name – Rudolf Rösch. Jewish Authors were banned. Urbach survived the Second World War and continued living in the United States, where she was often recognized on the street. She tried several times to regain the publisher's rights to her book, but she had no success.",

She started a catering service, and soon after, she opened a culinary school.

She convinced the architects to integrate the wayfinding graphics and signs she developed into the architectural structure. Her wholesome design concept opened the door for many airport projects after that. She designed and trademarked her typeface, introduced color and alphabetical coding for airport terminals, and established a stringed use of logos to support better wayfinding. Also, she was the first to expand her wayfinding concepts to highway signs around airports. Besides 40 international airport projects, she also worked on hospitals, sports arenas, universities, and subway systems. Her ideas and pioneer thinking are still guiding ways for millions of people today.",

        intro:  'Maria Sybilla Merian was born in 1647 in Germany and lived in Germany and the Netherlands. She discovered and researched metamorphosis at 13 by documenting the changes in caterpillars in drawings. She received painting lessons from her father, a well-known publisher. Her goal was never to earn money but rather self-fulfillment by discovering plants and insects. She was also one of the first to combine research through documentary art practice, thus uniting practice and theory. At first, her discoveries were not scientifically accepted because they needed to be formulated in Latin. Later, she became a respected businesswoman and inspired many women. For example, she traveled with her children to South America to research more plants and insects. To this day, her detailed copperplate engravings are well known, and many places, research centers, schools, and museums are named after her.',

Soon she became an influential contributor to the development of the picture language Isotype. The intention was to collect data according to logical-empirical methods and to convey it in the form of visual statistics to people regardless of their level of education and societal status. Economic, sociological, and democratic education of society was seen as the requirement for societal improvement. During World War II, the Isotype team was forced to flee. First to Den Hague, later to London, where she and Otto Neurath married and founded the Isotype-Institute. She continued the Isotype-Project for 30 more years after the death of Otto Neurath in 1945, and is responsible for the documentation, publication, success, and recognition of the Isotype work today.',

During her work, she discovered the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Bruce Heezen dismissed these findings as "girl talk" because they supported continental drift, which was controversial at the time. After comparing rifts to earthquake epicenter maps, Tharp´s findings were meaningful. Today Tharp is considered one of the most significant cartographers of the 20th century.',

        intro:  "Harris was born in Richmond, Virginia during 1953. As she grew she experienced racism and attended a desegregated high school. Harris has stated that she remembers her mother shouting from her car at the Ku Klux Klan while they were displaying on the street. Her father coached women&#8217;s sports, and her mother was an art teacher and artist. After graduating from her Master&#8217;s in Fine Arts, she eventually married her husband Gary Singer, with whom she had one daughter, Thai. <br> Harris was the creative director behind the design of the 2000 Census for the United States Census Bureau. The goal of the 1998 user-centred form redesign was to encourage Americans, including those who were previously underrepresented citizens, to participate, Harris believed that this is an important project, that&#8217;s why she accepted to take over.",
