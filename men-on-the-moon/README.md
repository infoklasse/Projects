### Semesterprojekt, 2023/24

The moon has fascinated mankind for thousands of years â€“ its surface, characterised by countless craters, tells stories from the past. In the 20th century, these craters began to be systematically named, often after European men. On this website you can discover the craters of the moon and find out more about the people they were named after. Using filter options, you can sort and explore the crater names according to their origin or the time of their naming.
